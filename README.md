# Entrostat OTP Assessment

A full-stack OTP verification system for the Entrostat technical assessment.

The project is structured as a small monorepo with a TypeScript Express API, a Vite React frontend, shared TypeScript utilities, Prisma-managed PostgreSQL data access, and Docker Compose support for local database development.

## Key Features

- Request an OTP for a user identifier.
- Resend OTPs within defined resend limits.
- Expire OTPs after a configurable duration.
- Validate only the latest issued OTP.
- Enforce single-use verification.
- Apply request and resend rate limits.
- Provide a frontend testing interface for the OTP flow.
- Cover core OTP business rules with automated tests.

## Tech Stack

- Monorepo: npm workspaces
- Backend: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- Frontend: Vite, React, TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Animation: Framer Motion
- Database: PostgreSQL
- ORM: Prisma
- Validation: Zod
- Testing: Vitest or Jest, with Supertest for API tests
- Local development: Docker Compose
- Deployment: Vercel frontend, Render backend, Neon PostgreSQL database

## Local Setup

Install dependencies from the repository root:

```sh
npm install
```

Root tooling commands are available from the repository root:

```sh
npm run dev
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run format:check
npm test
```

Expected local workflow:

1. Install dependencies.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
3. Start PostgreSQL with Docker Compose.
4. Run database migrations.
5. Start the API and web development servers.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are listed in `.env.example`. Concrete values should be supplied locally and in deployment environments.

## Deployment

Deployment configuration will be added after the application implementation is in place.

Planned deployment targets:

- Frontend: Vercel
- Backend: Render
- Database: Neon PostgreSQL

## Project Status

Steps 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 complete: project structure, documentation skeleton, agent orchestration documentation alignment, root tooling foundation, the initial Express API scaffold with a health route, and the shared API response contract package.

The next step is the API route test harness with Supertest and baseline health/error tests. Implementation of OTP logic, frontend screens, Prisma schema, and deployment configuration is intentionally deferred to later steps.
